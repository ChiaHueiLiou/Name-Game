## Name Game - Gender Prediction using Sound

##### By CHIAHUEI LIOU | Student of International Business in National Taiwan University

### Project Description

<p>The same name can be spelled out in a many ways (for example, Marc and Mark, or Elizabeth and Elisabeth). Sound can, therefore, be a better way to match names than spelling. In this project, I use fuzzy name matching and dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration to predict the genders of authors.</p>

### Purpose

<p>The purpose of the project is to predict the genders of the authors that were listed in the New York Times Best Seller for Children's Picture books. Further, I'll analyze the gender distribution of authors to see if there have been changed over time.</p>

### Data

<p>For the analysis, I use the datas “babynames_nysiis.csv” and "nytkids_yearly.csv".<br> The first file contains the unique NYSIIS versions of baby names, and also includes the percentage of times the name appeared as a female name (perc_female) and the percentage of times it appeared as a male name (perc_male).<br> The second file records the authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books from 2008 to 2017.</p>
